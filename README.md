As apart of the Breakthrough Tech AI program I was tasked with creating a ML problem based on the data sets provided and building an appropriate model for this problem. I researched the WHR data set which provides happiness scores for different counties along with other relevant data. My ML problem looks to approximate the Log GDP of a country given features such as happiness, perceptions of corruption, democratic quality, etc. I chose to implement an SGD Regressor which uses stocastic gradient descent to fit the model.
